#version 420
/*

Referenced Code from SpriteLib 

Justification: Used the code as a base to understand the process of blurring and how to properly blur the scene 

Modifications: I changed it from frag_color to result, as I only wanted one assignment for frag_color
			   I also added a new array of weights and a for loop to replace the bulk of code 
			   (This idea was from looking at https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom)
			   This allow for more automation and to make the code cleaner
